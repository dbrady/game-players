# Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Tools
This section of game players is less about solving a puzzle or cheating at a
computer game and more about building tooling around D&D 5th Edition.

I know there are already many tools out there to support generating, tracking
and generally fiddling around with D&D stuff, but none of them are written by me
so here we are. Also, and more importantly, since I'm new to the 5th Edition
rules, I figured I'd play around with some tooling to help teach myself.

That... should probably tell you how useful this folder of tools is going to be
to you. Go write your own. It builds character.

I swear that pun was unintended, but looking back, I'm too proud of it to take
it back out.
