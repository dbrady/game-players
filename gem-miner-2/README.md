# Gem Miner 2

This tool renders maps from the Android game Gem Miner 2 to ASCII color text on
a console. Gem Miner 2 is a free game from Psym Mobile that you absolutely
should get and purchase all of the expansion packs for. The game is a bit dated
but is still highly playable.

This started as a scratch project to try to parse the map files and grew
organically as a script until it became unmanageble. The old script, now in
`bin/draw-mine-old`, is still quite serviceable at drawing the map geography and
any objects defined in the objects layer.

I assert no rights to any of Psym's data or game information; you should buy
their games.
